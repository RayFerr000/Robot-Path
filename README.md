A user is shown a GUI window that has n rectangular obstacles. All of the obstacles are oriented either horizontally or vertically. The user then inputs three mouse clicks. The first two specify the start position and the radius of the robot respectively. The third click designates where you want the robot to travel to. To solve this problem, I divided the screen using a Quadtree data structure. If the robot could travel to every point in the subdivided region without touching an obstacle, this region was considered GREEN. If the robot could not travel to any points inside a given sub-region without touching an obstacles, this region was considered RED. If the robot could travel to some points inside a given sub-region without touching an obstacle, this region was considered YELLOW and was thus sub-divided some more. This process was continued until all regions were either RED or Green. Once there was no more YELLOW regions, I performed a DFS amongst the GREEN regions to determine if there was a path from the start location to the goal.
